# Introduction

## What is Numpy?

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is open-source software.

## Features of NumPy

NumPy has various features including these important ones:

1. A powerful N-dimensional array object
2. Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
3. Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
4. Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

## Install Numpy

Before installing Numpy, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

Numpy can be installed via the following pip command:

```bash
pip install numpy

```

# How to import NumPy

To access NumPy and its functions import it in your Python code like this:

```bash
import numpy as np

```

We shorten the imported name to np for better readability of code using NumPy. This is a widely adopted convention that makes your code more readable for everyone working on it. We recommend to always use import numpy as np.
